// Package bpfsys contains low level functions related to syscalls and kernel interactions.
// It is seperated out into this package so the docs of the gobpfld package aren't cluttered.
// It is recommended to use the more abstract/high level functions available in gobpfld if at all possible.
// However this package is available for anyone how wants to use more low level functionality
package bpfsys
